# Keystore management

## Key types

Key types can be conditionally divided into two groups: **agents** and **validators**.

**Agents** keys are used for linking content, sending liquid tokens, delegating, redelegating, and undelegating tokens to validators. Also, withdrawing rewards, voting and creating multisig accounts.

- `pussy` a.k.a. address. Pussy application key.
  - Derived from account mnemonic phrase, generated by `pussy keys add`
  - e.g. `pussy15h6vd5f0wqps26zjlwrc6chah08ryu4hzzdwhc`

- `pussy pub` the public key of an account address. It is used for generating multisig addresses.  
  - Derived from account mnemonic phrase, generated by `pussy keys add`
  - e.g. `pussypub1zcjduc3q7fu03jnlu2xpl75s2nkt7krm6grh4cc5aqth73v0zwmea25wj2hsqhlqzm`

All agents keypairs are stored locally in the `PATH_TO_PUSSY/keys` folder. 

**Validators** are actors on the network committing new blocks by submitting their votes. This refers to the node itself, not a single person or a single account. Therefore, the public key here is referring to the nodes public key, not the public key of the agent address.

- `pussyvaloper` validator application-level address. It is associated with a public key `pussyvalconspub`. This is the address used to identify your validator publicly. The private key associated with this address is used to delegate, unbond, claim rewards, and participate in governance. Generated by pussy on the application level. Application keys are associated with a public key prefixed by `pussypub` and an address prefixed by pussy network. Both are derived from account keys generated by pussy keys add. 
  - e.g. `pussyvaloper1carzvgq3e6y3z5kz5y6gxp3wpy3qdrv928vyah`

-  the public key of node/validator address has been recently migrated to protobuf look. The private key associated with this Tendermint PubKey is used to sign prevotes and precommits.
  - Generated when the node is created
  - Get this value with `pussy tendermint show-validator`
  - e.g. `{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"YxN/kkQlXBwKNF4Cgi6tiqMh2ae8+tpo9VxENmFUhv8="}`

> Note: A validator's operator key is directly tied to an application key, but uses reserved prefixes solely for this purpose: `pussyvaloper`.

A nodes keypair is stored in `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` at `$HOME/.pussy/config` folder. You can delete them and restart `pussy` if you want to change this keypair. The new pair will be created automatically.

## Generate keys

You'll need an account private and public key pair \(a.k.a. `sk, pk` respectively\) to be able to receive funds, send txs, bond tx, etc.

To generate a new _secp256k1_ key:

```bash
pussy keys add <account_name>
```

Next, you will have to create a passphrase to protect the key on disk. The output of the above
the command will contain a _seed phrase_. It is recommended to save the _seed phrase_ in a safe
place so that in case you forget the password, you could eventually regenerate the key from
the seed phrase with the following command:

```bash
pussy keys add <account_name> --recover
```

Also, you can import your Cosmos account to `pussy cli` using seed phrase:

```bash
pussy keys add <account_name> --recover 
```

pussy provides compatibility of Cosmos with Pussy addresses.

You can check your application account details by account name:

```bash
pussy keys show <account_name>
```

You can see all of your available keys by typing:

```bash
pussy keys list
```

View the validator pubkey for your node by typing:

```bash
pussy tendermint show-validator
```

Note that this is the Tendermint signing key, _not_ the operator key you will use in delegation transactions.


**Important note**: Starting with v.38 cosmos-SDK uses os-native keyring to store all your keys. We've noticed that in certain cases this does not work well by default (for example if you don't have any GUI installed on your machine). If during the execution of the `pussy keys add` command you get this type of error:

```bash

You will have to use another keyring backend to keep your keys. Here are 2 options: store the files within the cli folder or a `pass` manager.

Using the keyring backend as a **local file**:

Execute:

```bash
pussy keys add <key_name> keyring-backend file
```

This means that you've saved your keyring-backend to a local file. *Note*, in this case, all the keys in your keyring will be encrypted using the same password. If you would like to set up a unique password for each key, you should set a unique `--home` folder for each key. To do that, just use `--home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/` with setup keyring backend and at all interactions with keys when using pussy cli:

```bash
pussy config keyring-backend file --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
pussy keys add <your_second_key_name> --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
pussy keys list --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
```
