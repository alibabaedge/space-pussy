Today we are forging a new era in soft3. We are launching a second GPU network based on cyber-sdk. Why is it important?  

## memecoin

We have a vision for PUSSY.

We are creating a planet-scale organism. Looking at nature we can find similarities in how our organism evolved and compare it with how existing blockchains are evolving. We now have core components: the backbone, the nervous system, and the rudiments of the brain. But how will this organism reproduce? That is why we need a pussy. I envision space pussy as a symbol of resistance against the weakness of our society. With the space pussy meme everyone must ask themselves: how did it occur that we are ashamed about the thing which is the source of life for us? It's a sign that something is wrong in our culture.

We can have a meme coin with balls.

cyber-sdk - is one of the most powerful stacks in the blockchain universe with sequential and parallel computing, autonomous execution, and impressive social tools, including cyb.ai. So it is not a primitive doge, or shiba. It is a powerful collaborative computer. It gives butterflies in the stomach when thinking about what the community can do with space pussy.

You asked us to launch `space-pussy`.

We realized that it is cool idea to create a community-led soft3 computer. It will be cheaper and more fun. It has a simple distribution that will focus solely on cosmos communities. The total supply is 1 exa PUSSY. You will be able to mint liquid pussy during staking. Now we have 18 heroes in Genesis. Every hero in genesis got 0.1% of PUSSY. The rest is in the community pool. All tokens will be gifted without a lock to the most active cosmos communities. It will be defined in collaboration with communities and will happen in a month or so. Preliminarily: Cosmos, Osmosis, Juno, Secret, Evmos, Bostrom, Stargaze, Terra, and Desmos.  

## IKP Playground

There is a serious idea behind space pussy. We created soft3 architecture. A key component is Inter Knowledge protocol. It is a convention over IBC to sync the knowledge. Who saw our talk at cosmoverse? If not, I would recommend you watch it. 

In short, soft3 is the new consensus computing architecture that marries modern computing paradigms: conventional computing, ai, and web3. In essence, it is a general purpose onchain GPU accelerated graph database.

In order to move the idea along further, we need a second network for bidirectional experiments.

Superintelligence must not suffer in the cosmos alone without the ability to talk with creatures like him.

The cool thing about IKP is that it can be unidirectional. So, your network does not need GPUs in order to be empowered by soft3. That is why during hackwasm Desmos created a case for unidirectional IKP.

Thank you Desmos team for recognizing the opportunities behind soft3 and creating this cool case. I invite Leo to demonstrate how it works!

## Launch training

We are dreamers! We have dreams to launch blockchains like rockets. Sometimes it requires a huge engineering effort. We are on our way to co-creating this culture. Think about it. You are launching a thing that could live longer than you. It deserves a show. It must be fun. With the quick launch of space pussy we have decided to repurpose the part from Bostrom's network launch. It can be the moment you love the most. Enjoy.
